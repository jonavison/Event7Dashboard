## Introduction Before Starting

Well, wow I must a little amazed! I have beed working my brain so hard these pas few days... Unfortunatly with not much results! Not very familiar with NestJs neither Vue3, It was a very interesting challenge for!

I should of probably asked.. But it was quite difficult to figure out, how to arhitecture the project. It's funny because, when i first read the assignement I was feeling very confident, a little database, some relations, some queries and a some fetching. But in the end it didn't work out like aspected.

Big Fail ( NO task validated) ! Hope you will still find some interesting parts inside the project.

## Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/event7-dashboard.git

I assume that you have Mysql server, and is already set up quite warmly..
we use pnpm / replace pnpm by "npm run" if prefered

# Install dependencies using npm

pnpm setup

# Update the variables.

.env

# Start the development server

pnpm start:dev

# Push the database schema

pnpm migrations:run

## Dev

pnpm dev

Et voila !

I must say I took really a long time to figure out how Nest Js works, they have good docs but stil time flows and you have to write and test. Nevertheless a lot have been learn, so Thank You :}

My biggest challenge was to seed data into the database.. I took hours trying different modules and libraries to make the life eaiser..!
